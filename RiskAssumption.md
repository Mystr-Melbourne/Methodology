# **Risk Assumption**

> ## **Learning Goal:**
> **We need to build something with low effort to gain the most research possible, we are still unsure whether we should keep working with what we have so far, and all of this will help us understand if we should PIVOT**

### **Test Case:**

* **Can we access private data?**\
    Test 1: Would you trust us with your data? *(Name, Position, Availablity)*

    > **Fail Condition:**\
    > Employee data cannot be shared to us, cannot conduct research

* **Could we reduce the cost of contractors for**
  * **cleaning?**
  * **catering?**
  * **bartending?**
  
  Test 2: Compare the payscale and budget of employees VS contractors\
  with salaries online, make a graph date with min, max, mean.

  > **Fail Condition:**\
  > Contractors are cheaper.

    Test 3: Determine who is hired, how many for each department and when they are hired by spotless.

    > **Fail Condition:**\
    > Spotless does not hire contractors

* **Do they have idle employees who want to take on work?**\
    Test 4: Check if there are shift workers with extra availability, check if they want to work more (survey?).

    > **Fail Condition:**\
    > There are no employed and idling employees with extra availablity
    > or they refuse to take on more work.
    
* **Can we improve what they already do?**\
    Test 5: Determine what their in house rostering system already does.

    > **Fail Condition:**\
    > We are not allowed to study it

* **How crucial is extra staff during busy events**\
    Test 7: ask about statistics - find an existing scenario they experienced

    > **Fail Condition:**\
    > No data provided

* **Qualification for different roles**\
    Test 8: How does spotless determine the right qualification for each role.\
    Test 9: Does spotless upskill any employees?
